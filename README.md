# Doolittle Project 
## Introduction 
After days of studying Python programming, I decided to work on a project, simple project replicating a hotel booking system.

## About 
The project as it is, is console based and looking forwad to implimenting a GUI based version of the programm soon as I grow in my coding lessons and tutorials. It is simple since I didn't implement much on classes and HOF.

## Explanation 
It has a starter menu, and menus based on the descion of the order, breakfast _br_, lunch _lu_ and Supper / dinner _di_. This then prints out a receipt after prompting the customer to take the quantity of the food needed.

**Since it's a intermediate project one can make modifications. Thank you.**
